# Topology Optimization Engine

This repo builds the engine behind the topology optimization project ToOp at EliaGroup. This provides a tool to perform topology optimization on a grid file including import, DC optimization and AC validation. Note that this does NOT provide a GUI or system integration code, you are expected to interact with the module through either python or kafka commands. You can check the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17529) for a high level academic introduction.
Please check out our [full documentation](https://eliagroup.github.io/ToOp).pages.github.io)


# Citation

If you use our work in scientific research, please cite [our paper on loadflowsolving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17529) and soon also the work on the optimizer architecture, which is to be released soon.

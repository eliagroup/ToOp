# Introduction

This repo builds the engine behind the topology optimization project ToOp at EliaGroup.
ToOp provides tools to perform topology optimization on a grid file including import, DC optimization and AC validation. 
The following resources may be helpful to grasp the key concepts:

- [Quickstart](./quickstart.md): Grasp the basics and follow along examples. The first one take you through a DC loadflow computation using the [DC Solver package](./dc_solver/intro.md).
- [Usage](./usage.md): Learn about the two different ways to use this software, either via python or kafka.
- [Topology Optimizer](./topology_optimizer/intro.md): Understand the key concepts behind the topology optimizer.

**Note**: This project does not provide a GUI or system integration code. 
You are expected to interact with the module through either python or kafka commands.

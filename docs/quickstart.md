# Quickstart

The ToOp repository contains a lot of functionality, which can be overwhelming if you look at it for the first time.
But you do not need to understand all of them to use the parts of importance to you.

However, it is helpful to grasp some of the key concepts and data structures.
If you want to do this first, please refer to [Usage](./usage.md).


## Understand by examples
We provide you with a couple of examples on how to use the repo.

If you want to jump straight into the full-fletched topological optimization, check out **[`notebooks/example3_e2e_pipeline.ipynb`](https://github.com/eliagroup/ToOp/blob/main/notebooks/example3_e2e_pipeline.ipynb)**.
You can run any grid file (compatible with PyPowsybl) of your choice and investigate the effects.
If you want to take smaller steps, start with **[`notebooks/example1_dc_loadflow_example.ipynb`](https://github.com/eliagroup/ToOp/blob/main/notebooks/example1_dc_loadflow_example.ipynb)**.
After that, take a look at **[`notebooks/example2_small_grid_toop.ipynb`](https://github.com/eliagroup/ToOp/blob/main/notebooks/example2_small_grid_toop.ipynb)**.
This notebook optimizes a small node-breaker grid and displays the changes in the effected substation.
